## Word Prediction Algorithm

The developed word prediction is based on the ngram technique.
It is based on english language coming from twitter, blog and news data.

## Demo Available

A demo is available on Shiny:

[https://elkfield.shinyapps.io/Text_Prediction/](https://elkfield.shinyapps.io/Text_Prediction/)


## How the app works

- On the left hand side it is possible to choose on what data the algorithm is built.
- In the main window there is a textbox in which it is possible to enter a word or a phrase.
- Directly under the textbox there will appear the predicted next word including the entered beginning of the phrase.
- Additionally the three most likely words are also shown together with their probabilities
